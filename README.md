# xml-mapper

Provides the xml-to-raw function.
 
This takes the data structures returned by data.xml, and turns them in raw, friendly clojure data structures with no xml artifacts.

Inspired by Approach #3 here http://www.w3.org/2011/10/integration-workshop/s/ExperienceswithJSONandXMLTransformations.v08.pdf
   Converting from XML to JSON focusing on 'friendliness'.

This is NOT intended to be able to round trip.
